europeana 1914-1918
===================
europeana 1914-1918 uses a ruby on rails application based on runcoco
originally developed as cococo by richard doe, http://projects.oucs.ox.ac.uk/runcoco/,
for oxford univertyâ€™s great war archive, http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ww1lit/gwa/.

in january 2012, europeana began an iterative enhancement to the application that
created a diversion from the original runcoco software and the one being used
by europeana today.
