Setting up distributed sphinx hints

======  Configure webservers   =======

First of all both webserver and sphinx server need to run sphinx,
preferably same version


----- config/sphinx.yml -----
In production group set address and version


-----  config/initializers/thinking_sphinx.rb  ----
Set ThinkingSphinx.remote_sphinx = true


dummy text to trigger commit build bla


====  Configure sphinx server  =========
The web servers can not directly trigger the reindexing of the remote
Sphinx. Instead, you need to configure the Sphinx server with two cron
jobs. One that runs very often, e.g. every minute, that updates the
delta index; the other runs less often, e.g. every hour, and updates
the main index, resetting the delta index. Updating the delta index
every minute means there should be a maximum of one minute's delay in
database changes being reflected in search results.

The cron commands on the Sphinx server need to look as follows. For the more frequent delta index
rotation:
/usr/bin/indexer --config /etc/sphinx/sphinx.conf --rotate contribution_delta

For the less frequent core index rotation:
/usr/bin/indexer --config /etc/sphinx/sphinx.conf --rotate contribution_core


sphinx.conf  on the Sphinx server needs to be a copy of the Sphinx
configuration file generated on the web servers at
/var/www/cococo/config/production.sphinx.conf by the command

RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake ts:config 

but with paths and network address under the searchd { ... } section updated for its environment.

Any time the database structure is modified, the Sphinx configuration
file on the Sphinx server will need to be updated with the new
production.sphinx.conf that gets generated on the web servers by the command 

RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake ts:config




============

problems: if a cococo deploy is configured for remote sphinx the
db/sphinx structure doesnt get generated, but production.sphinx.conf
refers to files in this dir, so when this config file is copied to the
server running sphinx, sphinx fails to start on the db server,
since those files are missing.

a) Last time we were discussing this I added notes to the example
configuration files, so if you look in
/var/www/cococo/config/sphinx.yml.example you will see two additional
configuration settings for remote configurations: address and version.
Copy these to /var/www/cococo/config/sphinx.yml, uncomment and edit
for the Sphinx server's address and version of Sphinx.

/var/www/cococo/config/initializers/thinking_sphinx.rb.example to
/var/www/cococo/config/initializers/thinking_sphinx.rb and change the
ThinkingSphinx.remote_sphinx setting it contains from false to true.

contribution_delta
[12-03-12 12:13:49] Richard Doe: For the less frequent core index
rotation:
/usr/bin/indexer --config /etc/sphinx/sphinx.conf --rotate
contribution_core

to be updated with the new production.sphinx.conf that gets generated
on the web servers by the command RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec
rake ts:config[12-03-12 12:19:08] Richard Doe: I think that should
do it.
