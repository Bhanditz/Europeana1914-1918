      p1: Europeana 1914-1918 is based on an initiative at the University of Oxford
        where people across Britain were asked to bring family letters, photographs
        and keepsakes from the War to be digitised. The success of the idea – which
        became the Great War Archive – has encouraged Europeana, Europe’s digital
        archive, library and museum, to bring the German National Library into an
        alliance with Oxford University to roll out the scheme in Germany. The collaboration
        will bring German stories online alongside their British counterparts in a
        1914-18 archive.
