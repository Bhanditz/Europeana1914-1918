        heading: Background
        p1: <b>Europeana 1914-1918</b> is based on an initiative at the University
          of Oxford where people across Britain were asked to bring family letters,
          photographs and keepsakes from the War to be digitised. The success of the
          idea – which became the Great War Archive – has encouraged Europeana, Europe’s
          digital archive, library and museum, to bring other national or local institutions
          across Europe into an alliance with Oxford University. The collaboration
          brings European stories online alongside their British, German, Slovenian,
          Luxembourgian, Irish, etc. counterparts in a World War One stories collection.

          create by 2014 – the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War -
          a substantial digital collection of material from national library collections
          in eight countries that found themselves on different sides of the historic

            item1: The User is entitled to cease using the Service and close his Account
              at any time.
            item2: Europeana is at all times entitled to terminate and/or suspend
              the availability of the Service to the User if it considers there are
              grounds for doing so, without creating any liability on its part towards
              the User.
          article11:
            heading: Article 11 Miscellaneous, Applicable Law and Competent Court
            item1: These Terms for User Contributions and the use of the Service are
              governed by the laws of the Netherlands.
            item2: Where national or international rules of law do not contain mandatory
              provisions to the contrary, all disputes between the User and Europeana
              will, at the discretion of the party serving a summons or the party
              making an application, be brought before the competent court in the
              district of his place of residence or place of business, or before another
              court that is competent pursuant to national or international rules
              of law.
            item3: Should any provision of these Terms for User Contributions be or
              become invalid, the User and Europeana will remain bound to the remaining
              provisions. Europeana will replace the invalid provision by a valid
              provision, in accordance with the object and purport of these Terms
              of Use, in such a way that the new provision differs as little as possible
              from the invalid provisions.
          article2:
            heading: Article 2 Applicability
            item1: These Terms for User Contributions apply to Users, when they are
              using the Service. They do not apply to Visitors. The Europeana Terms
              of Use that can be found at <a href="http://www.europeana.eu/portal/termsofservice.html"
              target="_blank">http://www.europeana.eu/portal/termsofservice.html</a>
              apply to Visitors, including Users in their capacity as Visitors.
            item2: Europeana is entitled at all times to amend or supplement these
              Terms of Use. In such an event, the amended Terms for User Contributions
              will be sent to the User's Email Address. If the User continues using
              the Service after the amended or supplemented Terms for User Contributions
              have been sent to the Email Address, he thereby irrevocably accepts
              such conditions. If the User does not agree to the amended or supplemented
              Terms of Use, he must refrain from using the Service, and he must close
              his Account. The applicable Terms for User Contributions are available
              on the Website at all times.
          article3:
            heading: Article 3 Registration for the Service
            item1: Before Content or Metadata can be contributed to the Website, the
              User must create an Account in the manner described on the Website.
              During registration, the User must also enter a Username and a Password,
              which will provide access to the Account.
            item2: It is the responsibility of the User to keep the Username/Password
              combination confidential. The User is therefore responsible for all
              use that is made of the Service through the Username and the Password.
              Europeana may assume that the User is in fact the person who is seeking
              access with the Username and the Password that belong to him. As soon
              as the User is aware or as soon as he may have reason to suspect that
              a Username and/or Password has become known to unauthorized persons,
              the User must notify Europeana immediately. This does not affect his
              own obligation to take effective measures immediately, such as changing
              the Password.
            item3: If the User is younger than 16 years of age, he is only allowed
              to use the Service if he has the consent of his legal representative(s).
              By accepting these Terms of Use, the User guarantees that he is in fact
              16 years of age or older, or that he has obtained the consent of his
              legal representative(s) to create an Account and to use the Service.
            item4: Europeana reserves the right to alter the login procedure, the
              Password and/or the Username, if it considers this necessary in any
              way, for instance if this is in the interests of the operation of the
              Service. In that event, the User will be notified of this by email using
              the Email Address.
          article4:
            heading: Article 4 The Service
            item1: The User accepts that the Service only contains the functionality
              and other features found by him when using the Service. The Service
              is, therefore, delivered "as is". Europeana expressly excludes explicit
              and tacit guarantees, undertakings and warranties of any nature whatever,
              including but not limited to guarantees, promises and warranties with
              respect to the quality, safety, availability, lawfulness, integrity
              and correctness of the Service.
            item2: Europeana does not guarantee that the Website and/or the Service
              will at all times be accessible without interruptions or failures. Failures
              in the Website and/or the Service may occur as a result of, amongst
              other things, failures in Internet or telephone connections or because
              of viruses or faults/defects. Europeana is in no way responsible or
              liable for compensating the User for any damage or loss arising from
              or as a result of the Website and/or the Service being unavailable or
              temporarily unavailable, or in case of a breakdown of the Website and/or
              the Service.
            item3: Europeana is entitled, without any prior notice being required
              and without being liable to compensate the User, to close down or to
              temporarily close down the Website and/or the Service and/or to limit
              the use of it if it considers this necessary, for instance in connection
              with any reasonably necessary maintenance of the Website and/or the
              Service.
            item4: Europeana is entitled, without any prior announcement being required,
              to make procedural and technical changes and/or improvements to the
              Website and/or the Service.
          article5:
            heading: Article 5 Use of Content by Europeana
            item1: All Content contributed by the User to the Website will be made
              available by Europeana to Third Parties under the terms of the Creative
              Commons Attribution ShareAlike license.
            item2: In as far as the User is the proprietor of the Intellectual Property
              Rights in the Content contributed by him; he hereby authorizes Europeana
              to perform article 5.1 with respect to that Content. In as far as the
              User is not the proprietor of the Intellectual Property Rights in the
              Content contributed by him, he guarantees that either;
            item3: In as far as required in addition to the rights granted under Article
              5.2 in conjunction with Article 5.1, the User grants Europeana a free,
              unencumbered, world-wide, non-exclusive license for use, reproduction,
              distribution, communication and making available to the public of the
              Content, to the extent that this is necessary for the Service to be
              provided.
            item4: The license referred to in Article 5.3 ends once the User and/or
              Europeana remove(s) the relevant Content from the Website, or once the
              Account is removed by the User and/or Europeana, except for the situation
              where and in as far as Content has become part of a curated collection
              of Content on the Website which has been created by Europeana.eu or
              by Users of the Website.
            item5: Although the Website will indicate that use by third parties of
              the Content contributed by the User is governed by the Terms of the
              Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike license, the User acknowledges
              and accepts that Europeana is not responsible and/or liable for compliance
              by Visitors with the Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike license.
            subitem1: ! 'he is authorized by the proprietor of the Intellectual Property
              Rights in this Content to authorize Europeana to perform article 5.1
