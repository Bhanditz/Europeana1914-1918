        heading: Background
        p1: <b>Europeana 1914-1918</b> is based on an initiative at the University
          of Oxford where people across Britain were asked to bring family letters,
          photographs and keepsakes from the War to be digitised. The success of the
          idea – which became the Great War Archive – has encouraged Europeana, Europe’s
          digital archive, library and museum, to bring other national or local institutions
          across Europe into an alliance with Oxford University. The collaboration
          brings European stories online alongside their British, German, Slovenian,
          Luxembourgian, Irish, etc. counterparts in a World War One stories collection.
