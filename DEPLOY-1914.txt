dummy text testing hudson autobuild

===   Background   ===

Currently there is no obvious way to actually install this software,
here I am trying to document the steps needed for a fresh start.
This is a work in progress for the moment...

===   setup environment   ===

checkout this sourcetree

Install ruby

gem install bundle passenger

[in 1914 topdir]

bundle install  [user needs sudo privs]

===   setup database   ===

In config/database.yml make sure you have prepared both development
AND test with database,user and pw.   All doc tells you to only do development, but in order to
run this test is also needed. 
The test database will be created in the db:create step below, nothing
will actually be put into it. To make life easier for you keep the
dev,test and prod database privs separate, so you are sure how your
system talks to your db.


at prompt:

rake db:create  
rake db:schema:load
rake db:sessions:create

===   running server interactivly   ===
[in 1914 topdir]

rails server

===   clear gems   ===
this should hopefully remove all gems so you can start with a fresh
environment.

gem uninstall will_paginate warden tzinfo treetop thor thinking-sphinx sax-machine rspec-rails rspec-mocks rspec-expectations rspec-core rspec riddle rake railties rails rack-test rack-mount rack polyglot paperclip nokogiri mysql2 mime-types mail loofah i18n i18n-js http_accept_language hpricot globalize3 formtastic feedzirra fastercsv erubis diff-lcs devise curb cocaine bundler bundle builder bcrypt-ruby arel aegis activesupport activeresource activerecord activemodel actionpack actionmailer abstract passenger



===  redirects  ===
the following redirects will need to be implement on production at deployment.
need some help in regards to writing them so that the root domain is inferred
based on a regex so that the same .htaccess file can be used on development,
test and production
