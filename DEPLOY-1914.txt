===   Background   ===

Currently there is no obvious way to actually install this software,
here I am trying to document the steps needed for a fresh start.
This is a work in progress for the moment...

===   setup database   ===

In config/database.yml make sure you have prepared both development
AND test with database,user and pw.   All doc tells you to only do development, but in order to
run this test is also needed. 
The test database will be created in the db:create step below, nothing
will actually be put into it. To make life easier for you keep the
dev,test and prod database privs separate, so you are sure how your
system talks to your db.


at prompt:

rake db:create  
rake db:schema:load
rake db:sessions:create
