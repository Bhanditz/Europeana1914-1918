introduction
------------
this document attempts to detail the installation requirements and tasks needed
in order to set-up a local developer environment for europeanaâ€™s 1914-1918 website.
you can of course use any cli editor, however nano is assumed to be your cli editor
within these instructions.


required libraries
------------------
make sure all of the following libraries are installed. the easiest method is to
use a pacakage manager such as apt-get or homebrew to install them if they are
not already installed.

* curl
* git
* mysql

the following libraries are required in order for the ruby paperclip gem to work
properly.

* ffmpeg
  for creating thumbnails from videos

* ImageMagick
  for thumbnail creation

* ghostscript
  for creating thumbnails for pdfs


suggested ruby install
----------------------
use [rvm](http://rvm.io/). a helpful [ubuntu article](http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/ubuntu-ruby-rvm-rails-and-you/) for reference.

### install rvm (ubuntu)

```
curl -L get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --autolibs=packages
source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
rvm requirements
```

### install rvm (mac os x)

rvm uses a package manager to insure dependencies are installed. mac os x does
not come with a package manager. we recommendi using [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/).
if rvm does not find a package manager it will attempt to install and use macports.

* `--autoblibs` tells homebrew which pacakge manager to use
* `--ignore-dotfiles` stops rvm from creating a `.bash_profile` and `.bashrc` file,
  which you can be created manually as indicated below.

```
curl -L get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --autolibs=homebrew --ignore-dotfiles
source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
rvm requirements
```

### .bash_profile

create or add to a ~/.bash_profile file the following:

```
nano ~/.bash_profile
# Load RVM into a shell session *as a function*
[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"

# Set Rails Environment
export RAILS_ENV=development
```

### .bashrc
on a mac, instead of creating a .bashrc file with the following in it :

```
sudo nano ~/.bashrc
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.rvm/bin
```

you can create a file called rvm in /etc/paths.d with the following contents in it :

```
sudo nano /etc/paths.d rvm
/Users/your-username/.rvm/bin
```

### install ruby with rvm

any 1.9+ version should work

```
rvm install 1.9.3
```


project install
---------------
### clone the project

```
git clone -o github https://github.com/europeana/Europeana1914-1918.git
```

### create a gemset
create a gemset for the project

```
rvm gemset create 1914
```

### .ruby-version file
create a .ruby-version file. the .ruby-version file will make sure that rvm
switches to the ruby version specified in the file:

```
cd /Europeana1914-1918
nano .ruby-version
1.9.3
```

### .ruby-gemset file
create a .ruby-gemset file. the .ruby-gemset file will make sure that rvm
uses the gemset inidicated in the file:

```
cd /Europeana1914-1918
nano .ruby-gemset
1914
```

### confirm ruby version and gemset
confirm that the ruby version and gemset match what you expect

```
cd ..
cd /Europeana1914-1918
rvm info
```

### bundle install
bundle install, installs several packages for ruby that the project requires.
mac os x may have an issue with xcrun. to overcome it [see this gist]
(https://gist.github.com/thelibrarian/5520597)

```
cd /Europeana1914-1918
bundle install
```


configurations
--------------
the following commands assume that you are at the root path of the project

```
cd /Europeana1914-1918
```

### db config

create a db config file and edit the file as appropriate. make sure the socket
location is correct, e.g. /tmp/mysql.sock. if you run into an error indicating
mysql2/client.rb:44:in `connect': can't convert Fixnum into String (TypeError)
placing quotes around the databasename, username, and password may resolve the
issue.

```
cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
nano config/database.yml
```

### federated search

In order to retrieve federated search results you need to do the following:

```
cp config/federated_search.yml.example config/federated_search.yml
```

1. register for the appropriate api keys
1. add them to the development section of `config/federated_search.yml`

### sphinx config

if using sphinx, create a sphinx config file and edit the file as appropriate.

```
cp config/sphinx.yml.example config/sphinx.yml
nano config/sphinx.yml
```


environments
------------
the following commands assume that you are at the root path of the project

```
cd /Europeana1914-1918
```

### environment config

create an environment config and edit as appropriate.

```
cp config/environments/development.rb.example config/environments/development.rb
nano config/environments/development.rb
```


initializers
------------
the following commands assume that you are at the root path of the project.

```
cd /Europeana1914-1918
```

### create europeana config

create a europeana config file and edit the file as appropriate. make sure it
contains a valid europeana api key. if you get an exception error :
uninitialized constant EuropeanaController::Europeana then this config has
probably not been set properly.

```
cp config/initializers/europeana.rb.example config/initializers/europeana.rb
nano config/initializers/europeana.rb
````

### search suggestions config

create a search_suggestions config file and edit the file as appropriate. make
sure the recommended settings are uncommented by removing the # where necessary.

````
cp config/initializers/search_suggestion.rb.example config/initializers/search_suggestion.rb
nano config/initializers/search_suggestion.rb
````

### secret token

create a secret token file and edit the file as appropriate. make sure the token
is a phrase of at least 30 characters within quotes.

```
cp config/initializers/secret_token.rb.example config/initializers/secret_token.rb
nano config/initializers/secret_token.rb
```

### thinking sphinx config

if using sphinx, create a thinking sphinx config file and edit it as appropriate.

```
cp config/initializers/thinking_sphinx.rb.example config/initializers/thinking_sphinx.rb
nano config/initializers/thinking_sphinx.rb
```


database
--------
the credentials from the config/database.yml will be used to carry out the
rake commands mentioned below.

the following commands assume that you are at the root path of the project.

```
cd /Europeana1914-1918
```

### schema

make sure the database schema file is available to the db rake commands.

```
cp db/schema-example.rb db/schema.rb
```

### drop previous database

if necessary, or preferred, you can drop a previous version of the database.

```
bundle exec rake db:drop
```

### import a previous version of the database

if you want, you can import a production db dump instead of creating a clean database.

```
mysql -u user_name -p db_name < db_dump.sql
```

### migrate the db

used to make sure any existing database is up to date with any lifecycle database
changes.

```
bundle exec rake db:migrate
```

### create a clean version of the database

1. create the database
1. load the database schema
1. initialize the database with the seed data
1. run any necessary database migrations

```
bundle exec rake db:setup
```


update localization
-------------------
update the js localization files

```
bundle exec rake i18n:js:export
```


clear js & css cache

install solr
------------
make sure mysql is running
```
bundle exec rails generate sunspot_rails:install
bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start
bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:stop
```

### auto-complete

for auto-complete to work, copy from the following config files from the 1418
config directory to the solr config directory.

```
cp config/solr/conf/solrconfig.41.xml solr/conf/solrconfig.xml
cp config/solr/conf/schema.xml solr/conf/schema.xml
```

### pre-populate europeana records

1. download the [europeana_records.sql file](https://www.assembla.com/spaces/europeana-1914-1918/documents/a3L0TgGQer445wacwqjQWU/download/a3L0TgGQer445wacwqjQWU)
1. extract the file to a convenient location
1. import the sql into your local 1914-1918 db `mysql -u username -p databasename < path/example.sql`

### re-index solr

```
bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start
bundle exec rake sunspot:reindex
```

### configure application to use solr

Once the application has started, you may need to configure it to use solr.

1. sign-in to the site
1. browse to /admin/config/edit.
1. change the search engine drop-down setting to solr.


### solr dashboard

http://localhost:8982/solr/#/


start the server
----------------
```
rails server
# or
rails s
# or
bundle exec thin start
```


secure the admin account
------------------------
the admin account is setup with initial credentials shown in the seeds.rb. you should login
to the admin interface and modify those credentials in the My account : Edit sign in details
section


ruby help
---------
### set rails environment

before issuing a set of rake commands or starting rails, make sure the RAILS_ENV
is set to the proper environment: development, test, production. in your dev
environment you usually do not need to enter this command

```
RAILS_ENV=production
```

### rake tasks

display all of the rake tasks available

```
bundle exec rake --tasks
```

add --trace at the end of the command to see potential issues as the command issues

```
bundle exec rake rake-command assets:expire --trace
```


google usage statistics
-----------------------
add the google api key to the config/ directory
log into the site as an admin
go to the admin configuration page
add the appropriate google analytics key
add the google api email address @developer.gserviceaccount.com

stats are cached for one week
# to clear the cache
```
bundle exec rake cache:google_analytics:clear
```


upgrading pdf.js viewer
-----------------------
1.  make sure you already have node installed
1.  cd to a working directory for building pdf.js
1.  $git clone https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js.git
1.  $node make generic
1.  $cd /build/generic/web/
1.  $cp -R * /app/assets/javascripts/mozilla/pdf.js/
1.  $cd /build/generic/build/
1.  $cp pdf.js /app/assets/javascripts/mozilla/pdf.js/
1.  alter viewer.js
    comment out or delete the line
    var DEFAULT_URL = 'compressed.tracemonkey-pldi-09.pdf';
    comment out or delete the line
    PDFJS.workerSrc = '../build/pdf.js';
    replace it with
    PDFJS.workerSrc = '/app/assets/javascripts/mozilla/pdf.js/pdf.js';
1.	in the erb file, e.g., /app/views/themes/v3/views/attachments/_pdf.html.erb,
    make sure you have a line similar to the following before viewer.js loads
    <script>var DEFAULT_URL = '<%= @attachment.file.url(:original) %>';</script>
1.	alter viewer.css so that all url() entries point to /assets/mozilla/pdf.js/
    this is necessary because on test and in production the css reference is to a
		cached css file that resides outside the pdf.js folder



upgrading mediaelement
----------------------
1. cd to a working directory for storing mediaelement
1. $git clone https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement.git
1. $cp /path/to/mediaelement/build/* /path/to/europeana-1914-1918/app/assets/javascripts/mediaelement/
1. delete any text files copied to europena-1914-1918
1. alter mediaelementplayer.css so that all url() entries point to /assets/mediaelement/
   this is necessary because on test and in production the css reference is to a
   cached css file that resides outside the pdf.js folder



reset password on localhost
---------------------------
1. make sure you have the rails console open and available and the app is running
1. go to the sign-in page, http://localhost:3000/en/users/sign-in
1. click on forgot password?
1. enter your account email address
1. click submit
1. in the ruby console you'll find the reset password link you can use


update thumbnails and dimmensions
---------------------------------
add --trace at the end of the command to see potential issues as the command issues
```
bundle exec rake paperclip:refresh:thumbnails CLASS=Attachment
```


# On a Mac, a 1-line file in /etc/paths.d will be added to the path.  Imagemagick lives in /opt/local/bin, therefore:

cd /etc/paths.d

sudo nano opt
  /opt/local/bin
